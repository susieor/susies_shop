## Project Description
In this project, I designed and created a custom database, populated it with data, and carried out various analyses. The workflow involved:

Setting up the database schema.
Inserting data into the database.
Conducting analyses to extract insights.
Key analyses included examining spending patterns, identifying peak purchase days, and analysing customer behaviour.
